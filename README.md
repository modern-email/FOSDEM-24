## Meeting at FOSDEM [updated Jan 31 2024]

The main devroom day is on Sunday. It will be packed with talks! Not everyone,
especially those following the talks, will have time for discussions on Sunday.

Saturday (and also Friday evening) is perfect for meeting up and having
discussions. On Saturday, we'll meet up at 12:00 in the BoF C room, see
https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3657-modern-email-bof-creating-email-compat-data-more/.
Speakers, email developers and other email enthousiasts can also meet up
informally in the various cafeteria.

We'll also join up for dinner on Saturday evening.  It's not a "speakers
dinner" -- everybody interested in email is welcome.  We have a reservation at
Le Grand Cafe (https://www.legrandcafe.be/) from 19:00 onwards. There will
probably be a group leaving from the FOSDEM location.  To manage the
reservation, it will help if you let us know if you plan on joining, and with
how many.  But if you decide to join last-minute, we'll make it work!

Join the matrix room (see below) for coordinating during FOSDEM.

# Call for Participation in the "Modern Email" Developer Room at FOSDEM '24!

> [!NOTE]
> **Submissions are closed, speakers have received instructions**

Email is the workhorse of digital communication. It's one of the oldest
decentralized messaging platforms, and we must keep implementations up to date
with new standards/techniques/programming languages.

## Call for Participation

The "**Modern Email**" developer room is new at FOSDEM and seeks speakers,
volunteers, and participants! We want to get together as email
developers/users, learn about each other's projects, have technical
discussions, exchange implementation/operational experiences, and share plans
and visions for the future of email.

The Devroom will be **held on Sunday, February 4** in the afternoon, with
primarily talks on the schedule. The **submission deadline for talks is
~~December 1st, 2023~~ December 4th, 2023 (23:59 CET) (updated)**. We will also
informally meet with email developers on Saturday (that could be you; join us!)

* **Speaker**: As a speaker, you're invited to present your work in the developer room.
* **Volunteer**: As a volunteer, you would be helping us out during the sessions.
* **Participant**: As a participant, whether introverted or extroverted, you
  are excellent to everyone and make the day!

**Please distribute this CfP as widely as possible to interested parties!**

## Topics

Some suggestions for talks:

* Overview of the current state of email (as a keynote)
* Your free/open source software project(s) related to email. From demo to details.
* Current developments, upcoming standards, e.g. [JMAP](https://jmap.io),
  [structured email](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sml/about/), ...
* Efforts to modernize our email ecosystem, e.g., through implementations in
  modern languages.
* Integrating email with other software, e.g., through APIs.
* Message/transport security/authenticity.
* Experiences with deliverability, email operations, anti-spam, hosting, ...
* Related technologies such as calendaring/PIM.
* Visionary talks
    * Where should email be in 10 years?
    * Can we add end-to-end encryption (to the masses) through, e.g., MLS?
    * Can we provide simple solutions for on-prem (private) hosting?
* ...

## Submission

We ask for a short talk abstract (+ proposed duration) and a speaker biography
(+ contact info). Any material that shows your affinity to the field is also
appreciated, e.g., a collection of links to your work, talks, projects, blog
posts, etc.

Submissions **must** be made through Pretalx
(https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2024/cfp) no later than ~December 1st~ December 4th (23:59 CET) (updated).

The suggested duration for a talk is **25 minutes** (20 minutes presentation +
5 minutes Q&A). However, we *explicitly* invite you to propose the best
duration for your talk. If the best way to present your project is a **5-minute
lightning talk**, we'll happily arrange a lightning session!

Depending on the proposals, we may contact you to adapt the time of the session to fit the devroom schedule.

**Important**: Choose "**Modern Email**" in the track drop-down menu when
submitting your proposal. Otherwise, your proposal might go unnoticed!

Once the devroom schedule is finalized, we will contact you to help you prepare
your talk.
